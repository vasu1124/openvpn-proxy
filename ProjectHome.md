The OpenVPN Proxy enables to multiplex OpenVPN based ssl sessions.

If a) OpenVPN sessions need to be established in various fenced environments (which could have identical IP ranges), b) you only have limited internet IPs and c) your clientele can mostly only access the official port 443 via their enterprise http-proxy, then this tool is your friend.

If you have a commercial need or support question, please feel free to contact me.
