The OpenVPN Proxy enables to multiplex OpenVPN based ssl sessions.

If 

* OpenVPN sessions need to be established in various fenced environments (which could have identical IP ranges), and
* you only have limited internet IPs, and 
* your clientele can mostly only access the official port 443 via their enterprise http-proxy,

then this tool is your friend.

If you have a commercial need or support question, please feel free to contact me.
